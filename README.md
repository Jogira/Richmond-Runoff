# The goal of this project is the to make an app that will show the areas in Richmond that will be flooded after set amounts of rainfall. The webapp will let the user choose and compare different rainfall levels. The user will be able to zoom in or pan around Richmond to get a closer look at what buildings and streets will be flooded. The webapp will also allow for toggling on and off topographical views of the city. This project utilizes ARCgis Pro and Jupyter Notebook.

## Sponsoring Organization: Virginia Science Museum 

## Complete a model simulating rain run-off in Richmond from last year's Capstone.

The completed webapp version of the map may be viewed here:

Click the 3 horizontal lines at the top right to view the map legend. Alternatively, click the stack of squares at the top right to toggle on or off different levels of rainfall simulations or the elevation map. The searchbar at the top left also allows looking up specific buildings or streets instead of panning around. The colored areas indicate parts of Richmond that would be flooded under different levels of rainfall. For instance, the green overlay shows all areas that would be under 6 inches of rainfall, while the red overlay shows areas under a more extreme 60 inches of rainfall.
