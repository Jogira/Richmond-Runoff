Fortunately, the ARCgis Pro license supplied to us for this project comes with a web server hosting service. ARCgis would be used to gather all of the data and run the flood simulations, while Esri would then host all of that data on the web.
There is very little architecture to this project outside of that, as Esri and ARCgis were the only two services required to communicate with each other.
