The entire repository must be downloaded and placed within the same folder. Launch ARCgis Pro, 
and when prompted to start a new project, instead navigate to the "Flood" folder and then click the "Flood.aprx" file.

This will launch the project in ARCgis. Tick on or off the boxes on the lefthand side of the map to toggle the layers of each flood simulation. 
If any additional changes are made to the map and need to be shown on the website, go to the "Share" tab and click "Web map."
Handle any errors, then click "Publish." Visit this website to further change the map and style it.

To replicate this process, gather the LiDAR data (From sites like USGS or extract it yourself using ARCgis/ARCpy) for a chunk of land you want to run flood simulations on. 
Then, using the polygon tool, draw a shape that outlines the area you would like to conduct tests on.
After the shape has been completed, mask that shape with the LiDAR chunk to limit the LiDAR data to that area. 
Then using ARCgis's toolkits, use the raster calculator under geoprocessing to indicate what areas are above or below a certain elevation, relative to the nearest watershed.
